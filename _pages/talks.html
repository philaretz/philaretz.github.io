I use this page for selected talks and research presentations.

{% assign talks_sorted = site.talks | sort: "date" | reverse %}
{% if talks_sorted.size > 0 %}
  {% for post in talks_sorted %}
    {% include archive-single-talk.html %}
  {% endfor %}
{% else %}
No talks are currently listed. Please see the [Contact page](/contact/) if you would like details on recent presentations.
