We provide a mathematically rigorous Keldysh functional integral for fermionic quantum
field theories. We show convergence of a discrete-time Grassmann Gaussian integral representation in
the time-continuum limit under very general hypotheses. We also prove analyticity of the effective ac-
tion and explicit bounds for the truncated (connected) expectation values of the non-equilibrium
system. These bounds imply clustering with a summable decay in the thermodynamic limit, provided
these properties hold at time zero, and provided that the determinant bound δC and decay constant
αC of the fermionic Keldysh covariance are bounded uniformly in the volume. We then give bounds
for these constants and show that uniformity in the volume indeed holds for a general class of systems.
Finally we show that in the setting of dissipative quantum systems, these bounds are not necessarily
restricted to short times.
