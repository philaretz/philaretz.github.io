This paper puts the Keldysh approach to non-equilibrium fermionic systems on firm mathematical
ground. In practical terms, we prove that the functional-integral description has a well-defined
continuum limit, and that key observables remain controlled as system size grows. We also derive
explicit bounds that guarantee predictable decay of correlations under broad assumptions, including
for general classes of dissipative quantum systems.
