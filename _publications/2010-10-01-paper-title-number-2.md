We construct and analyze families of periodic delay orbits for a class of delay differential equations
in two dimensions depending on two real-valued functions. These families are parametrized by the delay
parameter. It is possible to represent the dependency of these periodic delay orbits on the delay parameter by
a curve in the plane, without loss of information. It turns out that the singularities of these curves necessarily
are cusps in the non-degenerate case. After discussing degenerate situations in general, we explain how to
glue different families of periodic delay orbits at degeneracies in the delay parameter.
